#Julius Save Me (20 points)  
This cipher involves shifty letters! ```Cnebnl Vtxltk bl max uxlm unm fr ykbxgw ebdxl Gtihexhg uxmmxk yhk patmxoxk kxtlhg. Ha pxee. Max yetz bl xtlrvmy{Gti0exhg_ol_Vt3l4k}```  
##Hint:  
You might want to read up on Caesar ciphers.  
  
##Solution:  
This problem is a simple Caesarean shift. It works by shifting every letter in a message by any number N such that 1 <= N <= 26. With a little guessing and the use of an online tool found [here](http://rumkin.com/tools/cipher/caesar.php), we see that the offset is 7, giving us the message:  
```Julius Caesar is the best but my friend likes Napoleon better for whatever reason. Oh well. The flag is easyctf{Nap0leon_vs_Ca3s4r}``` 
  
##Flag: easyctf{Nap0leon_vs_Ca3s4r}
