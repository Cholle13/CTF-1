#Plot Twist (20 Points)  
We need to get the flag at [this](https://www.easyctf.com/static/problems/plot-twist/index.html) site. That shouldn't be too hard.  
  
##Hint:  
There must be a backup on that site SOMEWHERE... you just have to look harder  
  
##Solution:  
When we follow the link, we see a website that isn't giving us much information. However, view the source of the page (`f12` on most browsers) and go to the console we find the message: `no one would EVER think to look in the console! flag backup: easyctf{remember_to_check_everywhere}`
